                <ul class="paragraph">
                  <li>Sets out our biocultural values and explains how we, the Raika, have developed and preserved
                    unique breeds of livestock and traditional knowledge associated with them, and how our pastoral lifestyle has
                    developed the co-evolved ecosystem of Rajasthan’s forests which we have traditionally conserved and sustainably
                    used;</li>
                  <li>Details our customary decision making process involved in providing free prior informed consent to any actions
                    that relate to our grazing rights, animal genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge;</li>
                  <li>Illustrates the disastrous impacts that our exclusion from previously communal grazing areas and forests is
                    having on our lives, livestock, genetic resources, traditional knowledge and the forest ecosystem itself;</li>
                  <li>Articulates our forest access rights and rights over our genetic resources and associated traditional
                    knowledge under Indian law;</li>

                <h3>OUR BIOCULTURAL VALUES</h3>
                <p id="para2" class="paragraph"><b>Where we live:</b> We are the Raika, an indigenous pastoral community who live in
                  Rajasthan, North West India. We number about 1m people, with the Maru Raika living across the State and the Godwad
                  Raika living in Pali, Jalore and Sirohi.</p>
                <p id="para3" class="paragraph">Despite the arid climate and the region’s dryland ecosystem, we have lived in the
                  region for over 700 years rearing unique livestock and acting as custodians of the local environment.</p>
                <p id="para4" class="paragraph"><b>Our origins:</b>At a spiritual level, we believe that we were created by Lord
                  Shiva. The camel was shaped by his wife, Parvati, and it was brought to life by Lord Shiva. But the camel’s
                  playfulness caused a nuisance, so Lord Shiva created the Raika from his skin and sweat to take care of the camels.
                  Our spiritual universe is linked to our livestock breeding, and our ethnicity is inextricably intertwined with our
                  breeds and way of life. We have always considered ourselves a distinct indigenous community, a fact that is
                  recorded, for example, in the 1891 Marwar census undertaken on behalf of the Maharaja of Jodhpur.</p>
                <p id="para5" class="paragraph"><b>Our traditional livelihoods:</b> We are indigenous nomadic pastoralists who have
                  developed a variety of livestock breeds based on our traditional knowledge and have customarily grazed our camels,
                  sheep, goats and cattle on communal lands and in forests. This means that our livelihoods and the survival of our
                  particular breeds are based on access to forests, gauchar (village communal grazing lands) and oran (sacred groves
                  attached to temples). In turn, our animals help conserve the biodiversity of the local ecosystems in which they
                  graze and we provide assistance to the area’s local communities. In this way, we see our indigenous pastoralist
                  culture as both using and benefitting from the forests, in a virtuous cycle.</p>

                <div class="overview">
                <h3>WE PRESERVE UNIQUE ANIMAL GENETIC RESOURCES AND HAVE ASSOCIATED TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE</h3>
                <p id="para6" class="paragraph"><b>Animal genetic resources:</b> Through our interaction with the forests, gauchar
                  and oran, and through selective breeding for generations we have created breeds that are particularly hardy, able
                  to forage and digest rough vegetation, withstand the dry Rajasthani environment and to walk long distances – all
                  attributes that “high performance” exotic breeds do not have. Local breeds need fewer inputs and are less
                  susceptible to disease and are well-suited to harsh conditions. The animal genetic diversity they embody enables
                  us to respond to changes in the natural environment, important attributes in the context of climate change
                  adaptation and food security. Their genetic traits and our traditional knowledge associated with them will also be
                  of use in breeding for disease resistance, and may provide us with other diverse economic opportunities under the
                  forthcoming International Regime on Access and Benefit Sharing or a future International Treaty on Animal Genetic
                  Resources for Food and Agriculture.</p>
                <p id="para7" class="paragraph">Specifically, we maintain the following breeds that are more fully described in
                  Appendix I:</p>
                <ul class="paragraph">
                  <li>Cattle: Nari and Kankrej;</li>
                  <li>Sheep: Boti (officially the Marwari) and Bhagli (officially the Sonadi);</li>
                  <li>Goat: Marwari and Sirohi;</li>
                  <li>Camels: Mewari, Marwari, Malvi; Bikaneri, Jaisalmeri</li>
                </ul>
                <p id="para8" class="paragraph">Many of our breeds are intrinsically migratory, and cannot be stall bred. Just as
                  our lifestyles are suited
                  to the conditions they require to survive, these breeds are suited to our biocultural realities.</p>
                <p id="para9" class="paragraph"><b>Traditional knowledge:</b> Our traditional knowledge relating to breeds and
                  breeding has arisen from centuries of experience of tending these particular breeds in Rajasthan. We have
                  traditional customs that ensure the genetic diversity of our breeds, such as the rotation of bulls between
                  villages for stud. We have also developed extensive local treatment systems (ethno-veterinary knowledge) with
                  which to care for wounded or ill animals, and much of this traditional knowledge is held by both the men and women
                  of our community. We share our ethno-veterinary knowledge freely with other communities that own livestock and are
                  perhaps the only veterinary care for livestock in remote areas of rural Rajasthan. Women also take care of the
                  newborn animals, make decisions about the sale or transfer of our livestock and sell milk. Our animal products are
                  totally organic, attributes that are highly desired in some parts of India. The wool of our animals is used for
                  making carpets, rope and blankets and they also provide draught.</p>

                <p id="para10" class="paragraph"><b>Spiritual understanding of our breeds:</b>Our breeds are more than just a
                  livelihood. They form an integral part of our social fabric and are interwoven with spiritual meaning. A number of
                  important holy days involve rituals that involve our animals and underscore the sacred ties between our livestock,
                  the environment and our traditional knowledge.</p>

                <h3>WE CONSERVE AND SUSTAINABLE USE RAJASTHAN’S BIODIVERSITY</h3>
                <p id="para11" class="paragraph">We are integral to Rajasthan’s forests, gauchar and oran. Our animals have
                  contributed to the ecology of the region to such an extent that they cannot be separated from the “natural” state
                  of the forests, gauchar and oran.</p>
                <p id="para12" class="paragraph">As our animals graze, they provide manure to otherwise infertile ground. At the
                  same time, the seeds in the manure have a higher chance of germination, provide gestation and increase the natural
                  propagation of local trees. Because our animals consume the foliage on the ground, it helps to keep termite
                  numbers low. The feeding on ground fall and tall grass has also lowered the incidence of forest fires.</p>
                <p id="para13" class="paragraph">For generations we, the Raika, have acted as custodians of the forest. We have
                  always fought forest fires, dealt with invasive species poisonous for animals (such as Angrezi Babul i.e. Prosopis
                  juliflora and the Rukadi i.e. Lantana camara) and reported illegal logging and poaching. Our customary laws ban
                  practices that degrade the environment, including the lopping of sacred trees, and heavy punishments are meted to
                  community members who break the rules.</p>
                <p id="para14" class="paragraph">Our grazing patterns are based on our traditional ecological knowledge and
                  establish a strict rotation based on the seasons over a five year period. At the same we stimulate tree growth by
                  our practice of lopping of selected trees, as well as by our camels that eat the twigs and leaves of the upper
                  branches. Studies on our grazing patterns have shown stronger tree growth in areas where our livestock have
                  traditionally grazed.</p>
                <p id="para15" class="paragraph">Our livestock has become integral to the animal diversity in forest areas.
                  Predators such as leopards and wolves have traditionally preyed on our livestock and we consider the resulting
                  loss of livestock as a natural part of our integral relationship with the ecosystem. Studies in the Kumbhalgarh
                  Sanctuary have shown how the leopard population in the region has been sustained by our livestock and the negative
                  impacts caused by the exclusion of livestock from the Sanctuary which include increased encroachment by leopards
                  into villages leading to dangerous conflicts.</p>
                <p id="para16" class="paragraph">We also provide services to the villages near our grazing lands and migratory
                  routes. We provide manure to farmers, either by keeping our animals on their land on a temporary basis, or by
                  selling it to them directly. People from surrounding villages use the forest for a variety of needs, including
                  collecting dry wood, fodder, agricultural nutrient inputs, medicines, thatch and famine foods. Villagers consider
                  us to be their guardians in the forest, offering guidance and protection to them in an otherwise dangerous area.
                  Members of our community use the forest for the collection of medicinal plants that are used to provide free
                  health assistance to our community and to people in other neighbouring villages.</p>
                <p id="para17" class="paragraph">Just as our breeds are unique because of the areas we graze them in, so the
                  forests, gauchar and oran have evolved into particular kinds of pastoral based ecosystems because of our long-term
                  interaction with them. We are integral to the forests, gauchar and oran: we cannot survive without them and they
                  will suffer without us.</p>
                <p id="para18" class="paragraph">We want to continue to graze our animals in forests, gauchar and oran, in a way
                  that sustains the natural plant and animal ecology of these areas, maintains our diverse breeds, sustains our rich
                  traditional knowledge.</p>

                <h3>PRIOR INFORMED CONSENT & BENEFIT SHARING</h3>
                <p id="para19" class="paragraph">Our animal genetic resources and our associated traditional knowledge about
                  breeding and ethno- veterinary practices are collectively owned by the Raika.</p>
                <p id="para20" class="paragraph">We have customary laws that regulate decisions making in our communities. For
                  issues that relate to all community members, we form a samaj (community) panchayat that is constituted by our
                  elders who stretch from one to twenty four villages depending on the gravity and applicability of the decision.
                  Our elders who constitute the community panchayat follow our customary laws and norms of decision making that have
                  been followed for generations.</p>
                <p id="para21" class="paragraph">Our community panchayat should be engaged any time outside interests take decisions
                  that may affect our livelihoods or relate to our breeds and associated traditional knowledge. For example, before
                  any of our access rights to customary grazing areas are altered we must be consulted. Also, where researchers or
                  commercial interests want to access our animal genetic resources and / or associated traditional knowledge, we
                  must be given all relevant information with which to take a decision and given time to discuss the issues within
                  the community panchayat as our breed diversity and traditional knowledge are collectively held and their ownership
                  does not vest in any single individual. In cases where we decide to grant access to our animal genetic resources
                  or associated traditional knowledge, we have the right to negotiate a benefit sharing agreement that includes
                  mutually agreed terms.</p>

                <h3>Grant access to our animal genetic resources or associated traditional knowledge,<br /> we have the right to
                  negotiate a benefit sharing agreement that includes mutually agreed terms.</h3>
                <p id="para22" class="paragraph">Despite this incredible genetic diversity and associated traditional knowledge that
                  we have developed, we remain mainly landless people and are highly dependent on our customary grazing rights over
                  forest and communal lands. Traditionally we have grazed our animals in Rajasthan’s forests and in the gauchar and
                  oran over the monsoon (July-September). Our exclusion from the forests, and shrinkage of gauchar and oran severely
                  threatens our entire existence and the co-evolved ecological system of these biodiversity rich areas that have
                  been developed through generations of complex interplay between livestock, livestock keepers and the local
                  ecosystem.</p>
                <img src="	http://mitan.in/bcp/raika/Images/img6.jpg " alt="images" />
                <h3>A. Forests</h3>
                <p id="para23" class="paragraph">We have customarily grazed our livestock on a seasonal basis in Rajasthan’s forests
                  for centuries. The Kumbhalgah Wildlife Sanctuary is a case in point. The Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Sanctuary is a 562
                  square kilometre range of reserved forest under the management of the Rajasthan State Forest Department. We have
                  been historically provided with grazing permits which have over the last few years been revoked and all grazing in
                  the forest has been banned without due process by the Forest Department. We were neither consulted about the
                  decision, nor compensated in any way.</p>
                <!--<img src="Images/img6.jpg" alt="images" style="float:right;"/>-->
                <p id="para24" class="paragraph">We respect the need to conserve the Kumbhalgarh Sanctuary’s biodiversity. Better
                  than anyone, we understand the importance of the ecosystem because it is has sustained our livestock and our
                  communities just as we have contributed to its conservation. Our exclusion from the forest has deeply affected our
                  livestock numbers and is having a negative effect on the forest ecosystem.</p>

                <h3>B. Gauchar and oran</h3>
                <p id="para25" class="paragraph">We have experienced the same fate regarding the shrinkage of gauchar (village
                  communal grazing lands) and oran (sacred groves attached to temples). These areas have become increasingly
                  diverted for other economic development projects. It is ironic that we - the very people who for centuries have
                  been the custodians of biodiversity and whose traditional lifestyles have developed and sustained the biodiversity
                  of the region - are now being denied access to it based on a limited understanding of the complex relationship
                  between us, our livestock and the local ecosystem.</p>

                      accessible communal areas for grazing our livestock is having on areas’ biodiversity, our animal genetic
                      resources and our future.</p>
                    <p id="para27" class="paragraph"><b>Biodiversity:</b>Our exclusion from forested areas is changing the ecosystem
                      and leading to a degraded ecology. The reduction in grazing is resulting in an excess of grass and foliage on
                      the ground that is leading to an increase in the prevalence and severity of forest fires. The pits that are
                      dug to inhibit the spread of forest fires are proving to be ineffective in combating this serious issue due to
                      the dry grass that has begun to grow in these pits. The excess ground fall is leading to disequilibrium in
                      termite numbers that can affect the health of the trees.</p>
                    <p id="para28" class="paragraph">At the same time, we are unable to act as custodians of the forest, so illegal
                      logging, poaching and crimes are being committed in areas that we once managed according to our customary
                      laws. The continual work we undertook to eradicate harmful or invasive species has ceased, and with it
                      precipitous increases in plants that are either harmful to animals or risk destabilizing the local ecology.
                    </p>
                    <p id="para29" class="paragraph">The reduction in available prey for wild predators has led to their encroaching
                      on villages, causing conflict between communities and the wildlife. At the same time, we are unable to assist
                      members of other communities who need to access the forest, which is reducing the ability of communities to
                      benefit from the forests.</p>
                    <p id="para30" class="paragraph"><b>Animal genetic resources: </b>due to the significantly decreased amount of
                      grazing lands available to us, we have been forced to sell significant numbers of our livestock over the last
                      5 years. We are literally being forced to sell our livelihoods to feed ourselves. Our camel stocks have been
                      hardest hit, suffering a 50% decrease in the last 10 years, and this drop represents a significant threat to
                      the survival of the breed.</p>
                    <p id="para31" class="paragraph">With the sale of our livestock goes our traditional knowledge. As our herds
                      diminish, so does the transmission of breeding techniques, medicinal practices and ecological understanding of
                      the areas we used to graze on. The potential loss of the important animal genetic resources that we have
                      developed, in co-evolution with the Rajasthani ecology is significant for a world that is suffering from
                      climate change and food shortages.</p>
                    <p id="para32" class="paragraph"><b>Our future: </b>the continuing exclusion from areas for grazing raises
                      serious doubts about the viability of our way of life. With it will disappear our livestock, our culture and
                      the virtuous relationship between our herds and the Rajasthani landscapes we have sustained. We require
                      grazing rights and a corresponding increase in the market for our products to continue to sustain our
                      livelihoods and keep our unique breeds, including the camel.</p>
                    <p id="para33" class="paragraph">Our children no longer want to carry on our traditional way of life because of
                      the hardships associated with the lack of grazing but at the same time are returning frustrated from low
                      paying jobs in cities where they went as unskilled labourers. We are caught in a no man’s land of being unable
                      to carry on their traditional occupations and unwilling to suffer the indignities of life as unskilled
                      labourers.</p>

                    <p id="para34" class="paragraph">The Biological Diversity Act of 2002 in its efforts to fulfil India's
                      commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity provides for the conservation of biological
                      diversity, sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the
                      use of such biological diversity and associated traditional knowledge (TK). The Biological Diversity Act sets
                      up the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) and the Biological Diversity Rules of 2004 lists the functions of
                      the NBA as including regulating access to biological resources and associated TK for commercial and research
                      purposes. The NBA is also empowered to advise the Central Government on any matter relating to the
                      conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and associated TK and the fair and equitable sharing of
                      benefits arising from the utilization of biological resources and associated TK. <b><i>The Biological
                          Diversity Act among other things requires the Central Government under Section 36 to promote the
                          conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity through in situ conservation and minimize the
                          adverse effects on biological diversity of any project undertaken through environmental impact assessments
                          that includes public participation.</i></b>The Central Government is tasked with ensuring respect and
                      protection of associated TK of local communities in accordance with the recommendations of the NBA including
                      registration of TK and other sui generis methods for its protection.<b><i>Under Sec 38 the Central Government
                          is also required to preserve and protect those species that are on the verge of extinction.</i></b></p>
                    <p id="para35" class="paragraph">In order to ensure the effective fulfilment of the role of the NBA at a local
                      level, local bodies such as the Panchayats or Municipalities are required under Sec 41 to set up Biodiversity
                      Management Committees (BMCs) to promote conservation and sustainable use and documentation of biological
                      diversity and associated TK. The NBA and the State Biodiversity Boards would consult with the BMCs while
                      taking any decision relating to the use of biological resources and associated TK within the territorial
                      jurisdiction of the BMC. Under Rule 22 (6) of the Biological Diversity Rules of 2004 the main function of the
                      BMC is to prepare a Peoples Biodiversity Register in consultation with the local people which shall contain
                      comprehensive information on availability and knowledge of local biological resources and their associated TK.
                      The Biological Diversity Act under Sec 21 envisages that the NBA will base its approval regarding any
                      application for access to biological resources or associated TK on the whether a mutually agreed terms and
                      fair and equitable benefit sharing has been negotiated with the local community that provides such resource or
                      associated TK (benefit claimers according to Sec 2 (a) of the Biological Diversity Act). The local community
                      or benefit claimers in question will be identified according to the Peoples Biodiversity Register under the

                      Convention on Biological Diversity recognizes that the forest dwelling scheduled tribes and other traditional
                      forest dwellers are integral to the survival of the forest ecosystem. The Forest Act seeks to address the long
                      term insecurity of land tenure and of these communities and therefore recognizes the rights of forest dwelling
                      tribes and other traditional forest dwellers, which include nomadic or settled pastoralists, on all forest
                      lands.</p>
                    <p id="para38" class="paragraph">The Forest Rights Act therefore provides certain rights to the Raika community:

                      socio-economic wellbeing. Animal genetic resources and pastoralists are among the areas it focuses on to
                      achieve in situ conservation according to the NBA.</p>
                    <p id="para41" class="paragraph">The NPF acknowledges livestock keepers’ inherent rights to continue to use and
                      develop their own breeding stock and breeding practices and calls on the government to recognize these rights,
                      acknowledge livestock keepers’ contribution to the national economy, and adapt its policies and legal
                      frameworks accordingly. As part of this effort, it underscores the need to document the indigenous knowledge
                      of pastoral communities about animal conservation, maintenance and breeding.</p>
                    <p id="para42" class="paragraph">To achieve these aims, the NPF calls for:</p>
